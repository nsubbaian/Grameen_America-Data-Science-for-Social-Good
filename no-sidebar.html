									<p>On this page, we've outlined some <b>additional insights</b> we had while exploring and analyzing the dataset.</br>
									We tried to answer the <b>questions</b> Grameen America had, but found some <b>limitations</b> and <b>difficulty</b>.</br>
									Here are some of the additional insights we have, on <b>"Gentrification"</b> and <b>"Swipe vs Cash"</b> data.</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h2>"Gentrification"</h2>
									<p><i>"How might <b>gentrification</b> be affecting our <b>members</b>?"</br>
									"How might leading indicators of <b>gentrification</b>  affect <b>decisions</b> on where to start new branches?"</i></p>
<br>
								<p>"Gentrification" is a very <b>tricky</b> term, as it is <b><a href="https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/the-challenges-of-mapping-gentrification-851c13df5b9e">not easily defined</a></b> and
								can have <b>different meanings</b> and <b>implications.</b>
								Instead of <b>defining</b> "gentrification" like we did for "retention," we decided to focus on <b>specific features</b> that
								may or may not be related to gentrification, that are more <b>indicative</b> (such as median rent, income, etc).
								We wanted to focus on the <b>changes over time</b>, and referenced external sources like 
								the <b><a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs">American Community Survey</a></b> or the <b><a href="https://www.census.gov/">US Census Bureau</a></b> Data.
								
								<br>
								<br>
								For analysis, we looked into features that could be implications of gentrification, 
								such as <b>home value</b>, <b>household income</b>, <b>population</b>, and <b>education levels</b>
								by <b>zip code</b>, and tried to track the <b>changes over time</b>, from 2015 - 2018.
								
								We tried to find trends through <b>feature importance</b>, using <i>XGBoost</i> and <i>Random Forest</i>.
								<br>
								
								However, there seemed to be <b>no trends</b> regarding features for "gentrification" and the members.
								Here are some of the graphs/plots showing our results.</br>
								<br>
								<i>insert pics or something here</i>
								<br>
								<br>
								These results <b>doesn't necessarily mean</b> that there are <b>no corerlations</b> between "gentrification"
								and the Grameen America members.
								There <b>could be factors</b> related to gentrification that influence Grameen America members,
								but it was not possible to find such trends with the <b>limited dataset</b> available.
								For example, for the Census data, only <b>3 years worth</b> of data was available to be used.
								There could have been trends if the data was available for a <b>longer period</b> of time.</p>

									<h2>"Swipe vs Cash Out"</h2>
									<p><i>"What leading <b>factors</b> explain the propensity to <b>swipe rather than withdraw cash</b>?"</i></p>
							<br>

								<p>Members of Grameen America can choose to <b>swipe the credit card</b> provided by Grameen,
								or can choose to <b>withdraw cash</b> to spend their loans.
								Grameen America encourages members to <b>use the card</b>, as it can help with <b>financial stability</b>
								and to build <b>credit scores</b>.
								<br>
								Grameen America had a dataset with the <b>swipe percentage</b> per member, for each loan cycle of 6 months.
								Using this dataset, we tried to find trends, using <b>regression</b> models and <b>feature importance</b>.
								<br>
								<br>
								However, there seemed to be <b>no trends</b> regarding swipe vs cash data for Grameen America members.
								Here are some of the graphs/plots showing our results.
								<br>
								<br>
								<i>insert pics or something here</i>
								<br>
								<br>
								These results <b>doesn't necessarily mean</b> that there are <b>no trends</b> for Swipe vs Cash.
								There <b>could be factors</b> related to swipe vs cash that influence Grameen America members,
								but it was not possible to find such trends with the <b>limited dataset</b> available.</br>
								</br>
								For the "Swipe vs Cash" dataset, only <b>20,647</b> datapoints out of the total <b>98,454</b> had usable information.
								That's only <b>20.97%</b> of the total dataset.</br>
								Out of this small portion of the dataset,<b>8,536</b> datapoints had <b>never</b> swiped their card, only cashing out.
								The meadian swipe percentage was <b>2%</b>, and the mean swipe percentage was <b>9.7%</b></br>
								<br>
								There might not have been any trends because an overwhelming majority of the members
								<b>did not use their cards</b> at all.</br>
								There were also <b>discrepencies</b> in the dataset itself, such as member's loan usage <b>changing</b> after
								the <b>6 month period</b> of the loan cycle, and some members' loan usage percentage <b>decreasing</b> over time. </br>
